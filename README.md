Part 1 — Reading Summary on Cigarette Butt Pollution

For Part 1 of the DiDE project, I reviewed four scientific articles that discuss cigarette butt pollution and its environmental impacts. All studies agree that cigarette butts are one of the most common types of litter worldwide. Each year, more than 4.5 to 6 trillion cigarettes are consumed, and a large portion of their filters end up in the environment instead of waste bins.
Cigarette filters are made of cellulose acetate, a non-biodegradable plastic that breaks down very slowly. As they degrade, they release microplastic fibers into the environment. According to the literature, cigarette butts contain thousands of chemicals, including heavy metals (lead, cadmium, nickel, zinc), nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aromatic amines, and BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene). These substances can easily leach into soil and water. Studies show that even low concentrations of cigarette butt leachate cause harmful effects on aquatic organisms, such as developmental abnormalities, stress responses, growth inhibition, and mortality.
Two of the reviewed studies examined the spatial distribution of cigarette butts in urban areas using the Cigarette Butt Pollution Index (CBPI). Their findings show that cigarette butt density varies depending on land use, population activity, season, and day of the week. Commercial and recreational areas tend to have the highest pollution levels. Warmer months and weekdays usually have higher cigarette butt accumulation. These studies highlight that cigarette butt pollution forms identifiable patterns and is strongly linked to human behavior.
Another article emphasized the long-term risks of cigarette butt littering. Because filters contain toxic chemicals, they pose threats to wildlife, aquatic ecosystems, and human health. Animals may ingest cigarette butts, mistaking them for food. Chemicals released from the filters can contaminate large volumes of water and contribute to environmental degradation. The article also notes that traditional waste disposal methods, such as landfilling and incineration, are not ideal for cigarette butt waste, and alternative solutions—including recycling into construction materials—have been proposed.
Overall, the reviewed literature shows that cigarette butts are not a simple aesthetic problem; they are a hazardous type of litter containing toxic substances that accumulate in the environment for long periods and negatively affect ecosystems.


Why addressing cigarette butt pollution is important and necessary for our campus

Addressing cigarette butt pollution on our campus is important for several reasons:
Environmental Protection: Cigarette butts release harmful chemicals into soil and water. Reducing this pollution helps protect campus green areas, plants, and small animals.
Human Health: Toxic substances inside cigarette filters can contaminate the environment where students and staff spend time. Minimizing cigarette butt waste contributes to a healthier campus atmosphere.
Microplastic Prevention: Since filters are made of plastic, every discarded cigarette butt contributes to microplastic pollution. Preventing litter reduces long-term environmental damage.
Clean and Pleasant Campus: Cigarette butts accumulate easily around benches, building entrances, and outdoor sitting areas. Managing this problem improves the appearance and overall experience of the campus.
Fire Safety: Improperly discarded cigarette butts can start fires, especially in dry seasons and grassy areas. Reducing cigarette litter decreases fire risks.

Conclusion

The scientific articles clearly show that cigarette butt pollution is an environmental, health, and safety concern. Cigarette butts contain hazardous chemicals, generate microplastic pollution, and persist in the environment for long periods. Reducing cigarette butt pollution on our campus is necessary to protect natural areas, ensure a safe environment for students and staff, and support sustainable campus practices.
